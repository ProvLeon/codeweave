Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
Testing and Deployment:
Conduct unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
Perform user acceptance testing
Deploy the application to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Heroku, AWS, etc.)
API Routes
User Authentication:
POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user
POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate a user
POST /api/auth/logout: Logout a user
Document Management:
GET /api/documents: Retrieve all documents
POST /api/documents: Create a new document
GET /api/documents/:id: Retrieve a specific document
PUT /api/documents/:id: Update a specific document
DELETE /api/documents/:id: Delete a specific document
Real-Time Collaboration:
WebSocket endpoint: /api/collaborate
Code Execution:
POST /api/execute: Execute code using Judge0 API

Risk Management
Concurrency Issues: Implement conflict resolution strategies (using Yjs or similar) and thorough testing.
Performance Bottlenecks: Optimize WebSocket implementation and API integration.
Security Concerns: Ensure secure authentication, data validation, and sandboxed code execution. Regularly review code for vulnerabilities.
Foreseen Limitations and Mitigations
Real-Time Synchronization Latency:
Limitation: Potential latency in real-time updates.
Mitigation: Optimize WebSocket communication and minimize payload sizes.
Code Execution Security:
Limitation: Executing arbitrary code can pose security risks.
Mitigation: Use sandboxed environments for code execution and limit resource usage.
Scalability:
Limitation: Handling a large number of concurrent users.
Mitigation: Implement load balancing and scale horizontally by adding more servers as needed.
Conclusion
CodeWeave aims to provide a robust platform for real-time collaborative code editing and execution. By leveraging modern web technologies and a well-structured development plan, the project can be completed within the three-week timeline, resulting in a unique and innovative tool for developers.
